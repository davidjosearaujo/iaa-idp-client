# Introduction
The objective of this report is to present an architecture and description of the services, general authentication and authorization flows, and a general risk tracking model. This serves as the basis for the creation of the applications and the Identity Provider (IdP).

# The IdP
The goal of the IdP is to identify and authenticate users and limit their access to resources using OAuth 2.0.

Service/application registration in the IdP should be configured through a configuration file without the need for any additional code, within the capabilities of the IdP.

## Supported authentication methods
Supported authentication methods:
- Password;
- One Time Password via email;
- [TOTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6238)/[HOTP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226) via a smartphone with support for any authentication application (e.g. Google Authenticator, Aegis);
- Portuguese citizen card.

An authorization token is the output of a successful login. This token is a random string and has a configurable expiration time after creation. The token can be updated if requested within its lifetime.

## Authentication risk tracking
The IdP will be able to **utilize context to determine the extent of the authentication flow required** to ensure user authentication. The following will be supported:
- Access IP history; 
- Number of logins in the last X hours;
- Number of login failed attempts in the last X hours.
- Login timestamp

Since the applications that use the IdP have access to more data to measure client-specific risk, an explicit risk value (two-levels) can be provided in the request, which will determine the required authentication flow.

## Authorization
In terms of authorization, the **IdP will only limit the access to the resource servers**, extra authorization mappings are stored and applied by the resource servers itself. **The access token returned by the IdP is a JWT with enough user-specific generic information** (e.g. group, role) and it's properly signed by the IdP. The set of rules in the IdP that limits the access of a given user to a resource server is defined in the service configurations in the IdP and should be based in the user's profile.

## Clients
**The clients of the IdP are the services that need the IdP for authentication and authorization.** Each client is identified by;
- *client_id* - random string.
- *client_secret* - random string.
- *issued_at* - timestamp.
- *expired_at* - timestamp.

Also, has attached to it the following metadata:
- *client_name* - string
- *client_uri* - string (URI)
- *grant_types* - string. We will only support the 'authorization_code' option since we want the user to go through the authentication process.
- *redirect_uris* - list of strings.
- *auth_methods* - list of authentication methods.
- *auth_flow* - structure that defines the flow of the authentication.

Each one is defined in a configuration file, but not all the data is the this file, but will be given to the user when the IdP boots.

## Endpoints
### Authentication Endpoint
- URL: `/oauth/authorize`
- Method: GET
- Arguments: client_id (str), client_secret (str)
- Returns:  redirect to registered redirect Url with authorization_code (str)
- Description: This endpoint is used by clients to initiate the OAuth 2 authentication process. When a client wants to authenticate a user, it redirects the user's browser to this endpoint. The IdP presents the user with a login page. After successful authentication, the user is redirected back to the client application with an authorization code (a random unique string).

### Resource Access Authorization Endpoint
- URL: `/oauth/token`
- Method: POST
- Arguments: authorization_code (str), client_id (str), client_secret (str), scope (str)
- Returns: accessToken (JWT), refreshToken (str)
- Description: This endpoint is used by clients to exchange the authorization code obtained from the authentication process for an access token and a refresh token. Clients send a POST request to this endpoint, and the IdP validates the authorization token and returns an access token along with an refresh token.

### Authentication Revoke Endpoint
- URL: `/oauth/revoke`
- Method: POST
- Arguments: access_token (str), client_id (str), client_secret (str)
- Returns: status
- Description: The services, when the user logs off or something happens that must finish the current session, the services (the clients) should send a request to this endpoint in order to revoke the access token.

### Registration Endpoint
- URL: `/registration`
- Method: POST
- Argument: client_id (str), client_secret (str), ... tbd
- Return: status 
- Description: We're talking about services (see next section) that shall not be accessible by everyone without a first intent from the bank. So, the user registry should be integrated within authorized services. This endpoint shall receive from the service very little information related with the bank and basic user information. The user will receive an email with a URL that will send him/her to a IdP page where the registration process will be finished (e.g. password and MFA setup).  

# Use case - Bank services

## Description
Authentication and authorization are paramount in banking services. The various parties involved in typical processes may have access to private information and/or perform critical operations. Excessive user access or identity theft can lead to significant economic impacts. Another aspect that is clearly evident in the case of banks is the conflict of interests, where an employee with sufficient privileges can benefit themselves or others associated with them.

## Roles/Agents and respective platforms
In this project, we're going to implement three platforms, each accessible to a set of users with a given role. The following are the roles (the agents):
- *Client* - bank client that has a active account in the bank;
- *Officer* - bank employee that works in one of the banks branch providing costumer support;
- *Account Manager* - bank employee responsible to manage a set of client accounts.

From those three roles we get three distinct services, respectively:
- *Home Banking*
- *Bank Officer Portal*
- *Account Manager Portal*

## Operations
A bank operation is vast and complex, so we've selected a set of operations that will be available to the agents through their respective platforms. The following features will be implemented (note that their labels will be used later):
- Home banking:
   - View account movements, account balances and account general information. An user can have multiple accounts.
   - Transfer money to another account;
   - Make payments;
   -  Change personal information.
- Bank Officer Portal:
   - View all accounts on the local branch. It can see all information related to the bank itself and high-level balances;
   - Make a loan request to a given client from a fixed set of pre-defined plans.
   - Request a new account creation (pending acceptance by the selected manager) 
- Account management portal:
   - View all information about the accounts under management;
   - Accept loan requests ( Must bide bank rate policies )
   - Accept account management
   - Delete accounts
   - Change account branch

# Authentication
For each agent, an authentication flow must be followed. Each of the diagrams presented in this sub-section represents the highest-risk level scenario.

## Home Banking
```{.mermaid caption="Home Banking authentication flow."}
flowchart LR
   A([Password])--> B{Is it correct?}
   B -- Yes --> H{Limit conditions met?}
   H -- Yes ---> D([HOTP/TOTP])
   H -- No --> C([Authenticated])
   B -- No ---> G{First time?}
   G -- No --> F([Add captcha])
   G -- Yes --> A
   F --> A
   D --> E{Is it correct?}
   E -- Yes --> C
   E -- No --> A
```

In normal cases the password is enough for the user to login, the full flow is followed when these limit conditions are met:
- The IP from which the user is trying to login was never seen before;
- Number of failed logins in the last 24 hours exceeds the set limit.

## Bank Officer Portal
```{.mermaid caption="Bank Officer Portal authentication flow."}
flowchart LR
   A([CC]) --> B{Is it known?}
   B -- NO --> A
   B -- Yes --> F{Limit conditions met?}
   F -- Yes --> D([Email OTP])
   F -- No --> C
   D --> E{Is it correct?}
   E -- Yes --> C([Authenticated])
   E -- No --> A
```
In normal cases the Citizens Card (CC) is enough for the user to login, the full flow is followed when these limit conditions are met:
- The IP from which the user is trying to login was never seen before. Ensuring that if the CC is stolen and the access is not made from the bank's officer computer.
- Every 1 week.

No logins in the platform can be made on a weekend.

## Account Manager Portal 
```{.mermaid caption="Account Manager Portal authentication flow."}
flowchart LR
   A([CC]) --> B{Is it known?}
   B -- Yes --> D([Email OTP])
   B -- No --> A
   D --> E{Is it correct?}
   E -- Yes --> H{Limit conditions met?}
   H -- Yes --> C([HOTP/TOTP])
   H -- No --> G
   C --> F{Is it correct?}
   F -- Yes --> G([Authenticated])
   F -- No --> A
   E -- No --> A
```

The CC and the Email OTP are always requires. MFA fatigue can be ignored in this case because the user is too critical. The HOTP/TOTP is only required when these limit conditions are met:
- It's a weekend or every day from 7pm to 7am
- The IP from which the user is trying to login was never seen before;
- In the last 24 hours the second step in the authentication (Email OTP) failed.

## Authentication revocation
Using the `auth/revoke` endpoint, all the services can revoke a session token. This system will me used to prevent token stealing. If the service detects that the client ip attached to the authentication token (a.k.a. session token) is not the one being used currently, it must revoke the authentication token. All the three services must have this security measure implemented.  


# Authorization
For each agent, distinct authorization criteria must be followed. Where possible, access control will be enforced by the IdP itself. In cases where this is not possible, the resource server will perform access control based on the information it stores and the access token provided by the client.

All the data needed for all the three applications to function, will be stored in the following resource servers:
- *Account information server* - stores and provides all the information about the bank's accounts.
- *Payment server* - enables clients to perform, upon request, money transfers and payments.
- *Loan server* - manages loan-related information.

Access control criteria can be directly mapped from the following subsections.

## Access Control

|  | View account movements | View account balances | Make Payments | Request Account Creation | Transfer Money | Update Client Info | View Account Info | Request Loan | Accept Loan Request | Delete Account | Change Account Branch | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Client | x | x | x | x | x | x | x | x | - | - | - |
| Bank Officer | - | x | - | x | - | - | x | x | - | - | - |
| Account Manager | x | x | - | x | - | - | x | x | x | x | x |

Have access: **x** | Doesn't have access: **-**

More limitations:
- A *bank officer* can't perform any action on accounts that he/she is titular;
- An *account manager* can't manage account where he/she is titular;
- An account deletion cannot be fully performed without explicit consent from the *client*. The client shall verify the action inside the Home Banking platform;
- A *client* when performing either a payment or a transfer, must present a set of digits corresponding to four random-generated index of a multi-channel code that was given to the user when the account was created via email;
- The *account manager* has a margin to adjust the loan request before accepting it, but it always must follow the bank's rate policies.

## Information Flow Control

Regarding account management, information flow control is paramount since read/write operations should not be allowed to all agents at every action they take part in. We can implement the Bell-La Padula MLS Model to specify controls where it is not possible to read up or write down the hierarchical tree.

In actions such as _Request Account Creation_ and _Request Loan_, the information follows the same pattern.

```{.mermaid caption="Request Account Creation and Request Loan information flow."}
flowchart LR
   A([Account Manager]) -- R --> B[Secondary Request]
   C([Bank Officer]) -- W --> B
   C -- R --> E[Primary Request]
   F([Client]) -- W --> E
```

When performing other actions such as _Change Account Branch_, the information flows from the top management to the bottom, and to ensure integrity of the action, the most appropriate model to implement is the Biba Integrity Model which ensures that data can only be written down and read above.

```{.mermaid caption="Change Account Branch information flow."}
flowchart LR
   A([Account Manager]) -- W --> B[New branch appointed]
   C([Bank Officer]) -- R --> B
   C -- W --> E[Account transition]
   F([Client]) -- R --> E
```

# Authentication/authorization flow
**The IdP does not enforce any structure; it requires two requests, one for the authorization token and one for the resource access token.** To keep the access tokens in the backend, and since there's no need for user interaction to obtain the access token, it can be easily done by the application backend after user authentication. This way, the user has access to an authorization token that, by itself, does not grant access to the resource servers. Therefore, the application is able to add more resource access restrictions.

```{.mermaid caption="Authentication/authorization flow."}
sequenceDiagram
   participant A as Browser
   participant B as Application
   participant C as IdP
   participant D as Resource Server
   
   A->>B: Open URL
   B->>A: Redirect to Auth
   A->>C: Redirect with Auth. code request
   loop Every required auth method
      C->>A: Please present your credentials
      A->>C: Present user-provided credentials
      C->>C: Verify credential
   end
   C->>A: Redirect to Application URL with authorization token
   A->>B: Follow redirect
   B->>C: Resource access request with authorization token
   C->>C: Verify access
   C->>B: Return access token
   B->>D: Request resource with access token
   D->>B: Return resource
   B->>A: Present page
```

# Conclusions
In this preliminary report lays the groundwork for the development of a flexible, risk-aware authentication system. Additionally, it presents a use case based on three distinct bank services that allow some basic, yet critical, operations. By defining the agents (roles), operations (and their flow), and access control criteria, the report provides a base for the authentication and authorization characteristics to be implemented.

Further refinement will be necessary to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed system. This will follow an agile workflow that will be developed as the project progresses.
