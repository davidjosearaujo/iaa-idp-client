# Resource Servers

All the data needed for all the three applications to function, will be stored in three resource servers:
- *Account information server* (`/account_info`) - stores and provides all the information about the bank's accounts.
- *Payment server* (`/payments`) - enables clients to perform, upon request, money transfers and payments.
- *Loan server* (`/loans`) - manages loan-related information.
